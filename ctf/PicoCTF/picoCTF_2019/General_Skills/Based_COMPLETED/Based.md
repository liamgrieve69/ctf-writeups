# we get an output of '01101111 01110110 01100101 01101110' and asked to give it as a word this is binary so i used an online coverter and the word is 'oven'(this is binary)

# then we are asked to give this as a word '143 157 155 160 165 164 145 162' as a word and that is 'computer' this is octal

# then we are asked for this as a word '6c696d65' this is hex and the word is 'lime' then we are given the flag 'picoCTF{learning_about_converting_values_b375bb16}'
