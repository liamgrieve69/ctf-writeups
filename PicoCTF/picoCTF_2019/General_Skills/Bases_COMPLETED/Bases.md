# What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

```
picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
```

this is base64 so i decoded it in my terminal by using the command 'echo 'bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1'|base64 -d'

this echos the base64 encoded string into base64 and the '-d' is to decode it.
